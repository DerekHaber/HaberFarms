            <p class="text-gray-700">Welcome to Haber Farms, your local farm in Eastern Jackson County dedicated to providing fresh, sustainable, and locally grown produce. Founded in 2025, we specialize in a variety of offerings, including nutrient-rich microgreens, artisanal sourdough bread, farm-fresh eggs, seasonal vegetables, and sweet berries. Our farming practices focus on reducing waste, ensuring that any products not sold are either preserved, enjoyed, or composted to benefit the next harvest. We are passionate about cultivating healthy food that brings value to our community and the environment.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-700 mb-4">Our Mission</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">At Haber Farms, we aim to provide our community with wholesome food that is grown responsibly and with care. Our mission is not just about farming â€“ it's about connecting with our customers, nurturing the land, and producing food that is both healthy and sustainable.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-700 mb-4">Our Story</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">We are a Christian owned and operated farm, passionate in naturally grown food, as we are called to treat our bodies as a temple of God. We believe in growing all natural food by taking advantage of the natural nutrients and fertilizers that God has gifted us</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-green-700 mb-4">Who We Are</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">Our owners, Derek and Mayci Haber, decided in 2024 to begin planning for a small farm as soon as they would get property. In October 2024, they officially bought their house, and had enough yard for a small suburban farm. This led to the beginnings of Haber Farms in Janurary, 2025!</p>
